# To-Do-List

I made the webpage using <i>HTML, CSS and Javascript</i>.<br><br>

The webpage has the following functionalities:-<be>
<ul>
  <li>When you try to add an empty text to the task list, it will give you a prompt message.</li>
  <li>After entering the task in the text input box you can add the task in the task list by clicking on the "<i>Add Task</i>" button.</li>
  <li>Similarly to remove a task you can click on the <i>Remove Task</i> button in the task div.</li>
  <li>On marking the checkbook checked to show that your task is completed the background of the task div changes from Red to Green.</li>
  <li>The <i>date</i> and <i>time</i> on the top right corner gets updated every second.</li>
</ul>
